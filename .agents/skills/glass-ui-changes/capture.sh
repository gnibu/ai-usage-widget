# Drives the installed app, not a dev build, for the reason in SKILL.md: a
# second copy gets a status item the window server parks off-screen.
#
# Everything is captured with `screencapture -l <windowID>`, never with a region
# crop. A region crop of a 460x297 card on a busy desktop caught a browser
# window sitting in front of it — a private URL and a half-filled sign-in form —
# because the card sits *behind* every window by default. `-l` reads the
# window's own backing store, so occlusion and the desktop behind it are both
# irrelevant, and the corners come out with real alpha.
#
# Requires an unlocked screen and, just as importantly, a machine nobody else is
# using. This script drives the real cursor and the panel closes the moment it
# stops being key, so a human clicking anywhere mid-run both steals the pointer
# back and dismisses the thing being photographed. Run it while away from the
# keyboard; it takes about fifteen seconds.

    Done. Two things to check before committing:

    1. Open every PNG and look at it. These are captures of a live desktop.
    2. Note the DPI. A panel on a 1x external display captures at 1x while the
       card on a Retina built-in captures at 2x. For assets that match, move the
       menu bar to the built-in display (System Settings > Displays, drag the
       white bar) and re-run.
