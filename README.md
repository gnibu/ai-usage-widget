# Tokens on Track

**Use every token. Never run dry.**

Tokens on Track is a macOS menu bar app showing how much of your **Claude Code** and **Codex**
quota you have burned, and whether you are burning it faster than the window
refills. Refreshes every 15 minutes, and tells you when you are running hot.

- **Bar** — quota consumed in that window.
- **`┃` tick** — where the bar *should* be if you spent the window evenly.
  Fill left of the tick, you are under budget; right of it, you are ahead.
- **Colour** — position against the target, not absolute usage. Green at or
  under the target, orange up to 1.5× it, red beyond that or above 90% consumed.
- **Percentage** — quota used by default, or usage compared with the even-spend
  target when *Vs target* is selected in Settings. At 100% of target, spending
  is exactly where it should be now.
- **Working hours** — optionally spread the full quota over selected weekdays
  and hours while you are inside that schedule. Outside it, the target returns
  to the ordinary wall clock.
- **Right column** — when the window resets, as a wall-clock time.

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gnibu/ai-usage-widget.git
cd ai-usage-widget
./build.sh --install
```

That compiles, wraps the binary in `Tokens on Track.app`, ad-hoc signs it, copies it to
`/Applications` and launches it. Drop `--install` to build into `.build/` and
leave `/Applications` alone.

When upgrading from the Python/Übersicht version, `--install` unloads and
removes its launch agent and widget automatically. Übersicht itself and the
old pipx package are left installed; remove them separately if no longer used.

**Requirements:** macOS 14+, Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`), and
Claude Code and/or Codex already logged in. Either provider can be missing — you
get a per-provider error rather than a failure. Full Xcode is *not* needed;
there is no `.xcodeproj`, `build.sh` assembles the bundle by hand.

## What you get

**Menu bar.** The window in the most trouble, as its provider's logo, a ring
filled to its consumption and tinted by its position against the target, and
the selected percentage reading. Any of the three can be switched off, and you
can widen it to as many as four windows, which are simply the busiest ones — two Claude windows if
Claude owns the two busiest. Tick *Always keep every provider on screen* to hand
each provider a slot first instead, so a quiet Codex stays visible beside a loud
Claude at the cost of bumping a window that really is busier. The window's
initial sits in the hole of the ring (`w` week, `h` 5-hour, `s` spark week),
which is the one place a menu bar has room to spare. Click it for the dropdown.

**Dropdown.** Two tabs on a pane of glass. *Usage* leads with one line saying
whether you are fine — "On target everywhere", or how far above the target
the worst window is — then a row per window, with a **Refresh** button beside
the tabs. *Settings* holds everything else, so opening it can no longer push the
reading off the bottom of the screen.

**Desktop card.** The same reading, free-standing and roomier: a ring for the
worst window, the summary line, and a block per provider with a word for how
that provider on its own is doing. The whole card lights red from the inside
once a window is in trouble, so the state survives peripheral vision. Drag it
anywhere; the position is remembered by its top left corner, so it stays put
when a row appears. It sits just above the desktop icons and behind every window
by default — set *Card layer* to *Floating* to keep it in front instead.
Right-click it for refresh, hide and quit.

**Notifications.** One alert when a window passes your threshold, one when it is
above your target multiple. Each fires at most once per window; the
moment a window resets, the slate is wiped and the next crossing is announced
again.

The Settings tab groups them the way System Settings does: *Menu bar* (which
parts to draw, how many windows), *Display* (whether percentages show *Used* or
*Vs target*, desktop card on/off, its layer, open at login), *Working hours*
(selected days and one shared time range), *Alerts* (both thresholds, on
sliders rather than steppers), and *Refresh* (5, 15, 30 or 60 minutes).

### Working-hours target

The working-hours target is optional and off by default. While the current
local time is inside the selected schedule, each provider window's full 100%
quota is spread evenly over every selected working hour contained in that
window. That also redistributes the shares that a wall-clock target would have
assigned to evenings and weekends.

When the current time leaves the schedule, every window deliberately switches
back to an ordinary wall-clock target. The white target notch, target
percentage, colour, worst-window ranking and target alerts all use the active
calculation, so they may jump at the boundary. Target alerts are never
suppressed outside working hours. Windows with no scheduled overlap also use a
wall-clock target.

### Why not a WidgetKit widget

Because it would be strictly worse here. A widget extension runs sandboxed, so
it could read neither the Keychain nor `~/.codex/auth.json`, and it would need
an App Group — which needs a paid developer team — merely to see the cache the
app already writes. It would also need full Xcode to build, and it could only
sit in the widget grid. The desktop card drags anywhere and needs none of that.

## How it works

The app fetches on its own timer, on wake, and on demand, then writes
`~/.local/share/ai-usage/usage.json` (override the directory with
`AI_USAGE_DIR`). Everything on screen is drawn from that one file, so the menu
bar ring, the dropdown and the desktop card can never disagree.

| Source file | Job |
| --- | --- |
| `Fetcher.swift` | reads both credential stores, calls both usage APIs |
| `Report.swift` | the JSON written to the cache |
| `WorkSchedule.swift` | local working intervals, DST and schedule boundaries |
| `Pace.swift` | target share, active time basis, pace rate, colours, reset labels |
| `UsageCard.swift` | the reading, shared by the dropdown and the desktop card |
| `Glass.swift` | the glass surfaces, tracks, ring and controls both are built from |
| `StatusIcon.swift` | the menu bar item — logo, ring, percentage |
| `BrandGlyph.swift` | reads `Resources/Icons/*.svg` into drawable outlines |
| `Notifier.swift` | threshold and target alerts, one per window instance |
| `UsageStore.swift` | the single reading, its timer, and the cache |

### Where the numbers come from

| Provider | Credential | Endpoint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude | Keychain item `Claude Code-credentials` (written by Claude Code) | `GET api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage` |
| Codex | `~/.codex/auth.json` (written by the Codex CLI) | `GET chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/usage` |

Both are the same first-party endpoints the CLIs themselves call, and both are
**undocumented internal APIs**. They can change shape or start rejecting
non-CLI callers without notice. That is the most likely way this breaks.

Which windows appear depends on what each API returns for your plan:

- Claude reports `five_hour` and `seven_day`.
- Codex reports a primary window, an optional secondary one, and any
  model-specific buckets from `additional_rate_limits` (e.g. GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark)
  as their own row. On Pro today only weekly windows come back —
  `secondary_window` is `null`. If a 5-hour window reappears it is rendered with
  no change.

## Security

Worth understanding before running something that touches your API credentials.

- Reads the Claude OAuth token via `/usr/bin/security` and the Codex token from
  `~/.codex/auth.json` — the two stores the CLIs already maintain.
- Sends each token *only* to its own provider's host. No third party, no
  telemetry, no analytics.
- Never prints or logs a token. The cache holds percentages, reset timestamps
  and plan names — nothing secret.
- Read-only on both credential stores. It never writes or refreshes tokens, so
  it cannot invalidate either CLI's login.
- No dependencies beyond the system frameworks. There is no supply chain to
  audit beyond this repo. Read it; it is short.

**Ad-hoc signing.** The app is signed with an ad-hoc identity, which is enough
for notifications and the login item but means the signature changes on every
rebuild. macOS may re-ask for Keychain consent after a rebuild; that is expected.

## Troubleshooting

**Menu bar shows a letter instead of a logo**

`BrandGlyph` falls back to the provider's initial when it cannot read
`Resources/Icons`. That happens when the app is run straight out of `swift
build` rather than from the bundle `build.sh` assembles. Point it at the working
copy with `AI_USAGE_ICONS=$PWD/Resources/Icons`, or just use `./build.sh`.

**Menu bar item missing**

macOS hides status items when the bar runs out of room, and menu bar managers
(Bartender, Ice, Hidden Bar) park them off-screen by default. Check the app is
alive with `pgrep -fl "Tokens on Track"`, then look in your manager's hidden section.

**Desktop card missing**

By default it sits behind every window, so a maximised window hides it. Show the
desktop, or set *Card layer* to *Floating*. If it was dragged to a screen
that is no longer attached, it comes back to the top right on the next launch.

**No notifications**

The app asks for permission on first launch. If it was refused, re-enable it
under System Settings → Notifications → Tokens on Track. Notifications need the app to
be signed, which `build.sh` handles — running the raw `swift build` binary skips
them on purpose.

**`stored token went stale — run claude once` / `run codex once`**

You are still signed in. Each CLI keeps a refresh token and mints a new access
token when it next runs, so the copy this app reads out of their store lapses on
its own — overnight, typically. Start the relevant CLI once and the next fetch
recovers. By design this app never refreshes tokens itself — it will not touch
your logins.

Until it recovers, the rows carry the last reading that did land, dimmed, with
the notice saying when it was taken. They are dropped once they are three hours
old or their window has reset, whichever comes first.

**`http 403` from Codex**

The edge in front of `chatgpt.com` intermittently rejects a valid request. The
fetch already retries once; a later run generally succeeds.

**Reading is stale**

The header marks a reading `(stale)` once the cache is more than 45 minutes old.
Hit **Refresh**; if that fails the per-provider error says why.

## Uninstall

```sh
osascript -e 'quit app "Tokens on Track"'
